# C-function-via-JNI
This is the source code of an assignment for my Program Structures course taught by Ravi Narayan at UH Manoa.

The application itself is a simple temperature converter that takes a max temperature value in Celsius > 0 and displays all temperatures from 0 to the given temperature rounded to the next multiple of 5, in multiples of 5.

### Main purpose
This particular assignment uses the Java Native Interface (JNI) to make calls from a Java frontend to a C function that does the calculation. 

This assignment had relatively minimal direct instruction and was focused on the ability to do research and write code using new techniques and libraries independently
